Fingerprint recognition usuing raw images and minutae-based feature extraction
---
To classify fingerprints from FCV2004 dataset machine learning three classification methods used and results were compared.
The project used 2 methods.

Method1:
---
Using raw images and train defined classifiers with them. Very low accuracy was observed in this method. So extracte fingerprint minutiea was decided and then train again which lead us to method2.

Method2:
---
Extracting fingerprint minutea and
